        <h1 style="color: black;">Topological Data Analysis - The use of persistent homology for time series classification.</h1> </div>

    <div class='intro' id="intro">
        <p> This website has been created as part of a six-week summer research project by NUI Galway Undergraduate Mathematics students Catherine Higgins, Matt O'Reilly and Paul Armstrong. We would like to acknowledge the support of the NUI Galway Summer Undergraduate Internship Programme 2020 and express our thanks to our supervisor Professor Graham Ellis for the expert guidance and assistance we received during this project. 
        <h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>
         Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a developing branch of data science which uses statistical learning and techniques from algebraic topology, such as persistent homology, to study data. Time series that arise in areas such as biology and finance can be very chaotic in nature and data analysis can be a challenging task due to the many difficulties that arise in understanding large, high-dimensional data that contains noise. TDA is an evolving tool that can be applied to complex systems with the aim of determining mathematical associations in the data by analysing properties that relate to the shape of the data. It provides a framework for analysing data that can gather information from large volumes of high-dimensional data, which is not dependant on the choice of metric and provides stability against noise.  </p>
        

    <div id="Aim" class='Aim'>
        <h1><u>Aim</u></h1>
        <p> This project aims to introduce students of mathematics to the use of persistent homology for time series classification through two illustrative examples. We will investigate the usefulness and effectiveness of  persistent homology in comparison to more traditional methods such as k-means clustering to classify time series. Investigations will be conducted on data from flour beetle populations and musical instruments based on two recent research papers <a href="./time-series-topology.pdf">"Persistent homology for time series and spatial data clustering" </a> - Cássio M.M. Pereira/Rodrigo F. de Mello and <a href="./music-topology.pdf"> “Computational Topology Techniques for Characterizing Time-Series Data” </a> - University of Colorado. </p>

        <h3><u>What is a Time Series?</u></h3>
        <p> A time series is a collection of numerical data points that are measured at successive evenly spaced intervals of time and indexed in time order. Examples of time series include the continuous monitoring of a person’s heart rate, hourly readings of air temperature, daily closing price of a company stock, monthly rainfall data and yearly sales figures.
        <br>

        Time series are made up of four components:
        <ol>
            <li>Trend variations - The predictable long-term pattern of the time series.</li>
            <li>Seasonal variations- Repeated behaviour in the data that occurs at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>Cyclical variations - Occurs when a series follows an up and down pattern that is not seasonal. </li>
            <li>Random variations – Do not fall under any of the above three classifications. </li>
            </ol>

        <h1><u> First Example: Population growth analysis of Tribolium flour beetle.</u></h1>
        <p>Cássio M.M. Pereira and Rodrigo F. de Mello’s paper "Persistent homology for time series and spatial data clustering" is concerned with analysing time series data and investigates, by means of three different examples, the use of persistent homology in comparison to k-means clustering.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> We focus on example 4.1 Population growth analysis of Tribolium flour beetle. Our aim was to recreate this example using R and the same model used in the paper for the Tribolium flour beetle to investigate if we could classify time series data using persistent homology more effectively than k-means clustering and to compare our results to that of the paper.  </p>

        <h1><u>Part 1: Construct time series.</u></h1>
        <p>The following R Libraries were required in our analysis.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
#ODE 
library(deSolve)

#Graphs and Data Manipulation
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)

#Confusion Matrix
library(caret) 

#Persistent Homology
library(nonlinearTseries)
library(TDAstats)

#Betti Numbers
library(matrixStats)
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p> First, we programmed a function to create 200 aperiodic time series and 200 stable time series. The same fixed parameters as outlined in the paper were used along with &mu;<sub>a</sub> = 0.73 for stable time series and &mu;<sub>a</sub> = 0.96 for aperiodic time series.
        The starting value of larvae L<sub>t</sub>, pupae P<sub>t</sub> and adults A<sub>t</sub> for each time series was randomized.
        The following equations were used to model the values of larvae, pupae and adult beetles respectively.</p>
        
        
        <p> \begin{equation}
            \begin{array}{l}
            L_{t+1}=b \cdot A_{t} \cdot \exp \left(-c_{e a} A_{t}-c_{e \ell} L_{t}+E_{1 t}\right) \\
            P_{t+1}=L_{t}\left(1-\mu_{\ell}\right) \exp \left(E_{2 t}\right) \\
            A_{t+1}=\left(P_{t} \exp \left(-c_{p a} A_{t}\right)+A_{t}\left(1-\mu_{a}\right)\right) \exp \left(E_{3 t}\right)
            \end{array}
            \end{equation}
        </p>        
        </ol></p>
        <p> Each time series was then converted to a row vector and appended to the data frame Time_Series_Data which contains all 400 time series required to do analysis.</p>

       <p> First, create 200 aperiodic time series.

        <h3><u>Aperiodic Time Series</u></h3>
        <pre>
            <code>
Time_Series_Data<- data.frame()
for (i in 1:200){
  parameters2 <- c(b = 7.48, c_ea = 0.009, c_pa = 0.004, c_el = 0.012, u_p = 0, u_l = 0.267, u_a = 0.96)

  beetles2<-function(t, state, parameters) {
    with(as.list(c(state, parameters)),{

      L1 <- b * A * exp((-c_el * L) - (c_ea * A))
      P1 <- L * (1 - u_l) 
      A1 <- (P * exp(-c_pa * A) + A * (1 - u_a)) 
      
      list(c(L1, P1, A1))
    })
  }


Aperiodic_i <- ode(y = state2, times = seq(0, 200), func = beetles2, parms = parameters2, method = "iteration")
  

aperiodic <- as.data.frame(Aperiodic_i) %>% select(A)

transposeAperiodic <- t(aperiodic) # Turns Column Vector into Row Vector

Time_Series_Data <- rbind.data.frame(transposeAperiodic,Time_Series_Data) 
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <p> Next, create 200 stable time series.

        <h3><u>Stable Time Series</u></h3>

        <pre>
            <code>
for (i in 1:200){
  parameters1 <- c(b = 7.48, c_ea = 0.009, c_pa = 0.004, c_el = 0.012, u_p = 0, u_l = 0.267, u_a = 0.73)

  state1 <- c(L = sample(2:100,1), P = sample(2:100,1), A = sample(2:100,1))
  
  beetles1<-function(t, state, parameters) {
    with(as.list(c(state, parameters)),{

      L1 <- b * A * exp((-c_el * L) - (c_ea * A))
      P1 <- L * (1 - u_l) 
      A1 <- (P * exp(-c_pa * A) + A * (1 - u_a)) 
      

      list(c(L1, P1, A1))
    }) 
  }

  
  Stable_i <- ode(y = state1, times = seq(0, 200), func = beetles1, parms = parameters1, method = "iteration")
  
stable <- as.data.frame(Stable_i) %>% select(A)
transposeStable<-t(stable)
Time_Series_Data <- rbind.data.frame(transposeStable,Time_Series_Data)
}
            </code>
        </pre>


        <p>Now all 400 time series have been created, transposed into row vectors and added to the data frame Time_Series_Data which contains all 400 time series. </p>
        <p> For ease of identification name each time series aperiodic or stable. </p>

        <pre>
            <code>
(setattr(Time_Series_Data, "row.names", c(rep("Stable",200),rep("Aperiodic",200))))
            </code>
        </pre>

        <div class="KMeans" id="KMeans">
        <h1><u>Part 2: Analysis of time series.</u></h1>
        <h3><u> K-means clustering</u></h3>

        <p> The k-means clustering algorithm was used to show comparison between persistent homology and a more traditional classification method. Using the k-means clustering alogrithim we attempt to correctly classify the time series data into two clusters: aperiodic and stable.</p>

        <pre>
            <code>
set.seed(250)
kmtotal <- kmeans(Time_Series_Data, 2, iter.max = 10, nstart = 1)

#Confusion matrix
km_clusters <- kmtotal$cluster
correct <- rep(c("1","2"), each=200)
cfm <- table(correct,km_clusters)

            </code>
        </pre>

        <p> In order to analyse the results of the k-means clustering algorithm we create a confusion matrix which shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.</p></div>
       
    
     <div id="ConfusionMatrix" class="ConfusionMatrix" >
        <p>
        \begin{aligned}
        &\begin{array}{rr}
        \text {} & + & - \\
        Stable & 200 & 0 \\
        Aperiodic & 119 & 81
        \end{array}
        \end{aligned}
        </p>
    </div>

    <p> From the confusion matrix above it can be seen that all 200 stable time series are correctly clustered. However, only 81 of the aperiodic time series are correctly classified.  </p>


    <h3><u>Takens' Theorem</u></h3>
        <p> Takens’ embedding theorem states that we can reconstruct a time series considering time delays. A series can be reconstructed in phase space where m is the embedding dimension (the smallest dimension required to embed an object) and t the time delay. Thus, instead of analysing the series along time, we analyse its trajectory as a set of visited states in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. This is particularly useful to extract the topological behaviour we are interested in. </p>
        <p> In the study of dynamical systems, a delay embedding theorem gives the conditions under which a chaotic dynamical system can be reconstructed from a sequence of observations of the state of a dynamical system. The reconstruction preserves the properties of the dynamical system that do not change under smooth coordinate changes (i.e., diffeomorphisms), but it does not preserve the geometric shape of structures in phase space. </p>

        <div class="Taken">
        <p> Let \(M\) be a compact \(C^2\) differentiable manifold of dimension \(m\).
        Let \(\Phi: M \rightarrow M\) be a \(C^2\)  diffeomorphism and let \(\mu: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be any \(C^2\) map. It is a generic property that the mapping 
        \begin{equation}
        \Phi_{\phi, \mu}: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2 m+1}, x \mapsto\left(\mu(x), \mu \phi(x), \mu \phi^{2}(x), \ldots, \mu \phi^{2 m}(x)\right)

        <p> Persistent homology is a method for computing topological features of a space at different spatial resolutions. The space must first be represented as a simplicial complex. More persistent features are detected over a wide range of spatial scales and are deemed more likely to represent true features of the underlying space rather than noise. </p>
        <p>A bar code is a visual representation of persistent homology. Long bars represent features and short bars represent noise. </p>
        
        
       
        <p> A persistence diagram is very similar to a barcode, it captures the birth and death of features. The x-coordinate of a point represents when that point was born and the y-coordinate represents when that feature died. Features that are short lived occur close to the 45 degree line, while more persistent features occur at a greater distance from the 45 degree line.  </p>

 <div class="First Conclusion">
        <h1><u>Part 3: Conclusion from first example</u> </h1>
        <p>Persistent homology is more effective at classifing the given time series data than k-means clustering. Both k-means clustering and persistent homology classify all 200 stable time series correctly. However there is quite a significant difference when it comes to classifing aperiodic time series. K-means clustering only correctly classifies 81 aperiodic time series whereas persistent homology correctly classifies 181 aperiodic time series. This shows how effective persistent homology is over k-means clustering at classifing time series data </p>
        <p> This example shows how effective topology can be and how it can be considered for use as an extra tool for statistics. </p>

Our aim is to try and classify an Instrument by its note and Accurately be able to predict the istrument by its barcode. To analyse the data of each instrument we used Audacity to get the Time Series for the data. Which can be downloaded<a href="https://www.audacityteam.org"> here.</a>
        </p>
        <p> A sample output from Audacity is seen below. A time series can be clearly seen in the track bar. This Time series is exported in a CSV file and imported into R.</p>

    <h2><u> Part 2: Analysis </u></h2>
    <p> The following code is used to Takens Embed the Time Series and then Calculate its homology and Betti Numbers. It is important to note that we are distinguishing instruments by the number of one dimensional holes.
