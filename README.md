# TDA-TimeSeries

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a branch of data science aiming to use methods of Algebraic Topology, In particular Persistent Homology, to analyze data. Time-series data arise in Biology and Finance and can be very chaotic in nature. TDA as a topological tool is robust to noise and can be applied to extract information from small data sets. My aim with this project is to understand how effective TDA is at analysing time series data.
